== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are grades calculated? =

WpCues Quiz computes the grade either on basis of total points collected or percentage correct answer scored  by the visitor. Then it finds the grade. For example: If you have 2 questions and the correct answers in them give 5 points each, the visitor will collect either 0, or 5 or 10 points at the end. You may decide to define grades "Failed" for 0 to 4 points and "Passed" for those who collected more than 4 points. In reality you are going to have more questions and answers and some answers may be partly correct which gives you full flexibility in assigning points and managing the grades.
You can also issue certificate on the basis of grade attained by the user.


= How do I show the quiz to the visitors of my blog? =

You need to create a post and embed the quiz short code. The quiz short code is shown in a column on Quiz table. Also you can directly insert from add/edit quiz form by clicking 'Insert into post' button.
You can place as many as exam shortcode as you want in a post /page or anywhere (even in widget in sidebar).

= How to translate the plugin interface in my language =

You can use the standard WordPress way of translating plugins (via Poedit and .po / .mo files).
If using Poedit, your file names should start with "watu-". For example: watu-de_DE.po / watu-de_DE.mo. They should be placed in wp-content/languages/plugins folder.
